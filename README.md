# BLIP Visual Question Answering

This project utilizes the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) model to perform Visual Question Answering (VQA) on images. Given an input image and a text-based question, the model generates descriptive answers based on the image content.

## Project Overview

The application loads an image, processes it using the BLIP model, and provides a relevant answer to a user-defined question. This can be useful for tasks such as:
- Image captioning
- Automated content descriptions
- Accessibility tools

## Features

- Load and process images
- Answer user-defined questions related to an image
- Pretrained BLIP model for high accuracy

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `transformers` - For loading the BLIP model
  - `Pillow` - For handling image processing
  - `torch` - For deep learning model inference

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blip-vqa.git
   cd blip-vqa
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your image in the project directory and rename it to `image.jpg`, or update the script with the correct file path.

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. The model will process the image and print the generated response.

## File Structure

```
blip-vqa-project/
│-- app.py              # Main application script
│-- requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
│-- README.md           # Project documentation
│-- image.jpg           # Input image (to be provided by the user)
```

## Example Output

```
Describe the photo for me?
"A person is sitting on a beach watching the sunset."
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Python and dependencies are installed correctly.
- Check the image path and format.
- Run the script in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.
